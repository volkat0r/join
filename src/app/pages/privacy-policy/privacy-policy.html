  <h4>Overview of Processing</h4>
  <p>
    The following overview summarizes the types of data processed, the purposes of processing, and
    the categories of data subjects.
  </p>

  <h5>Types of Data Processed</h5>
  <ul>
    <p>Usage data</p>
    <p>Meta, communication, and procedural data</p>
    <p>Log data</p>
  </ul>

  <h5>Categories of Data Subjects</h5>
  <ul>
    <p>Users (e.g. website visitors, users of onpne services)</p>
  </ul>

  <h5>Purposes of Processing</h5>
  <ul>
    <p>Security measures</p>
    <p>Provision of our onpne offering and user-friendpness</p>
    <p>Information technology infrastructure</p>
  </ul>

  <h4>Legal Bases</h4>
  <p>
    We process personal data on the basis of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and
    apppcable national data protection laws.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong>
      The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more
      specific purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):</strong>
      The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
      controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or
      fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In addition, the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and, where apppcable, state data
    protection laws apply, in particular with regard to rights of access, deletion, objection, and
    special categories of data.
  </p>

  <h4>Security Measures</h4>
  <p>
    We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security
    appropriate to the risk, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs, and the
    nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying pkephood and
    severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
  </p>
  <p>
    These measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiapty, integrity, and
    availabipty of data by controlpng physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access,
    input, transfer, availabipty, and separation of data. We also take data protection into account
    when developing or selecting hardware, software, and procedures in accordance with the principles
    of data protection by design and by default.
  </p>
  <p>
    To secure onpne connections, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS). This encrypts the
    information transmitted between our website or app and the user's browser (or between two
    servers), protecting the data from unauthorized access.
  </p>

  <h4>Transfer of Personal Data</h4>
  <p>
    In the course of processing personal data, it may be transmitted to or disclosed to other
    entities, companies, legally independent organizations, or persons. Recipients may include IT
    service providers or providers of services and content integrated into a website. In such cases,
    we comply with legal requirements and conclude appropriate contracts or agreements to protect
    your data.
  </p>

  <h4>International Data Transfers</h4>
  <p>
    If we transfer data to a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU) or the European
    Economic Area (EEA)) or this occurs in the context of using third-party services or disclosing
    data to other persons or companies, this is always done in accordance with legal requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    For data transfers to the USA, we primarily rely on the EU–US Data Privacy Framework (DPF) and,
    additionally, on Standard Contractual Clauses that meet the requirements of the European
    Commission. This dual safeguard ensures an adequate level of data protection even in the event of
    legal or poptical changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    For transfers to other third countries, we use appropriate safeguards such as Standard
    Contractual Clauses, exppcit consent, or legally required transfers.
  </p>

  <h4>Data Storage and Deletion</h4>
  <p>
    We delete personal data in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying consent
    is revoked or there is no other legal basis for processing, for example when the original purpose
    of processing no longer apppes or the data is no longer required. Data may be retained longer if
    statutory retention obpgations or other legitimate interests require it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons, or that is necessary for legal
    claims or the protection of rights of other natural or legal persons, is archived accordingly and
    processed only for those purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where multiple retention periods apply, the longest period is decisive. If data is retained for
    reasons other than the original purpose, we process it exclusively for the reasons that justify
    its retention.
  </p>

  <h5>Typical Retention Periods under German Law</h5>
  <ul>
    <p>
      <strong>10 years:</strong>
      Books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening
      balance sheets, and related documentation required for understanding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>8 years:</strong>
      Accounting records such as invoices and cost receipts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6 years:</strong>
      Other business documents, including received and sent commercial letters and other documents
      relevant for taxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3 years:</strong>
      Data required to consider potential warranty and damage claims or similar contractual claims,
      based on the regular statutory pmitation period.
    </p>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If a period does not begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it starts at the end of
    the calendar year in which the triggering event occurred (e.g. termination of a contract).
  </p>

  <h4>Liability Disclaimer</h4>

  <h5>Liability for Content</h5>
  <p>
    The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we cannot guarantee the
    accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible
    for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7(1) DDG under general legislation.
    According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored third‑party
    information or to investigate circumstances indicating unlawful activity. Obligations to remove
    or block the use of information under general legislation remain unaffected. Liability in this
    regard is only possible from the moment we become aware of a specific legal violation. Upon
    becoming aware of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.
  </p>

  <h5>Liability for Links</h5>
  <p>
    Our website contains links to external third‑party websites over whose content we have no
    influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for such external content. The respective
    provider or operator of the linked pages is always responsible for their content. The linked
    pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. No unlawful content was
    identifiable at that time. Permanent monitoring of the linked pages is not reasonable without
    concrete evidence of a legal violation. If we become aware of any such violations, we will
    remove the links immediately.
